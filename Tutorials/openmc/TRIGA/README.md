# TRIGA Mark II Reactor Model in OpenMC

This repository contains an OpenMC model of the TRIGA Mark II reactor, developed and validated using experimental data from the TRIGA reactor at the University of Pavia.

# Repository Contents

- _triga_model.ipynb_: Jupyter notebook containing the full workflow for setting up, running, and analyzing the TRIGA Mark II reactor simulation using OpenMC.

# Description

The model simulates the TRIGA Mark II research reactor using the Monte Carlo particle transport code OpenMC. It includes core geometry, material definitions, simulation parameters, and post-processing tools. The model has been verified and validated against experimental benchmarks, including:

- Criticality (keff) at various configurations
- Temperature reactivity coefficients
- Void reactivity coefficients

Additionally, the repository includes analysis supporting the study of neutron flux shadowing effects, with simplified and full-core modeling approaches.
