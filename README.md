# MultiPhysics in Python - OFELIA

**OFELIA: Openmc-FEnicsx for muLtiphysics tutorIAl**
**Authors**: Lorenzo Loi, Stefano Riva, Carolina Introini, Antonio Cammi

This repository collects the supporting code for OFELIA (Openmc-FEnicsx for muLtiphysics tutorIAl): an open-source tool to simulate multi-physics nuclear cases adopting [OpenMC (v 0.13.2)](https://openmc.org/) and [FEniCSx (v. 0.6.0)](https://fenicsproject.org/) for Python. Moreover, useful tutorials are available for the single-physics codes OpenMC and FEniCSx.

--------------------------------
**In the coming months, the code files supporting the findings will be published here once the peer-review process of the related journal article will be completed.**
